# How the Web Works
## How the Web Works
A tiped URL sends a request as a packet, which includes the IP address of the website you want. It sends this request through wires, which eventually links to the other side by means of the ISP.

The ISP redirects the request to the correspondent server, which will send the respond to that particular request back to you, in the form of a group of packets that will then be assembled by the web browser. This happens really fast.

Although this is a very high level explanation, for our purposes it is all we need to know for now.
## What does 'Full Stack' mean?
There are two main components of a website: Front and Back end.

- The Front-End is what you see as a user on the website. It revolves around three technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

- The Back-End is the technology used to actually decide what to show you on the Front-End. It has three components: the language used, the framework and the database. For our purposes, we will use Python as the language, Django as the framework, and SQLite as the database.

# DOM
Browsers will construct the DOM, which basically means storing all the HTML tags as Javascript objects.

Check it out by passing `document` to the console in the browser.

This DOM will allow us to use Javascript to interact with the web page. It's enormous, and most developers won't use all the properties.

We will cover the common objects used, but be prepared to the unknown.
